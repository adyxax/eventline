# Contributing to Eventline
Eventline is primarily developed by [Exograd](https://exograd). But Eventline
is also open source software, and you can help us make it better:

- Report and triage bugs.
- Write technical documentation and blog posts.
- Organize meetups and user groups in your local area.
- Help others by answering questions about Eventline.
- Contribute to the Eventline codebase.

We expect every contributor to adhere to the [Code of
Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Process
For spelling mistakes or small bug fixes, feel free to open an issue, with or
without an associated pull request.

If you have something larger in mind, such as new runners or connectors, we
advise you to describe it on GitHub discussions first.

Developing Eventline takes a lot of time, and we have to focus on the existing
roadmap and on our paying customers. We do our best to respond to requests on
a timely manner, but we cannot promise anything. Also note that code
contributions will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis, and will not be
automatically accepted.

Exograd can develop specific Eventline features on demand. [Contact
us](mailto:contact@exograd.com) for more information.

## Legal
By submitting a pull request, you disavow any rights or claims to any
changes submitted to the Eventline project and assign the copyright of
those changes to Exograd SAS.

If you cannot or do not want to reassign those rights (your employment
contract for your employer may not allow this), you should not submit a
pull request. Open an issue and someone else can do the work.
