== Managing your account

=== Configuration

The account configuration page lets you update several settings:

Date format :: The format used to display dates on the web interface, either
absolute (e.g. "2022-07-15T17:11:50Z") or relative (e.g. "3 hours ago").

Default page size :: The number of elements displayed on a page listing
multiple elements, for example the event list page.

=== API keys

Each account can define multiple API keys. Keys are used to access the HTTP
API, either using Evcli or with a client of your choice.

CAUTION: API key give access to your account and must be treated as sensitive
data.

Eventline only stores a cryptographic hash (SHA256) of each API key. When you
create a new API key, you must save its value: you will not be able to recover
it later.

API keys can be deleted at any moment to revoke access to Eventline.
