=== What is Eventline?

Writing scripts to automate recurring tasks is the bread and butter of every
developer, SRE or data scientist out there. But running these scripts is
always annoying: hosting, deployment, secret management, monitoring,
everything has to be handled correctly.

Eventline is a platform that stores, schedules, executes and monitors all your
jobs. You define what the job does, where to run it and when to trigger it;
Eventline takes care of everything else.

=== Features

Eventline is battery included by design, and provides multiple features
designed to make your life easier:

- Declarative job definitions with inline or external source code.
- Support for multiple runners: local execution, Docker, Kubernetes…
- Events used to trigger jobs when certain conditions are met.
- Manual execution with custom parameters and auto-generated forms.
- Identities to store credentials, with full OAuth2 support.
- Observability with access to all past runs of your jobs, success rate and
  performance monitoring, output logs…
- Full runtime control, letting you abort jobs, restart them and replay
  events.
- HTTP API and command line tool.
