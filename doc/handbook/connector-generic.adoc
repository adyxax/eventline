=== `generic`

The `generic` connector is used to provide generic identities to store
credentials for whom there are no dedicated connectors.

==== Identities

===== `api_key`

A generic API key.

.Data fields

`key` (string) :: The API key.

===== `password`

A generic login and password pair, the login being optional.

.Data fields

`login` (optional string) :: The login.

`password` (string) :: The password.

===== `ssh_key`

A SSH key.

.Data fields

`private_key` (string) :: The private key in PEM format.

`public_key` (optional string) :: The public key in PEM format.

`certificate` (optional string) :: The certificate in PEM format.

Note that OpenSSH will fail to load a private key, public key or certificate
file which does not end with a new line character (`\n`). Eventline will
automatically add one at the end of each field of this identity if there is
not already one present.

===== `oauth2`

The `generic/oauth2` identity can be used for any platform which complies with
OAuth2 specifications. If `discovery` is true, Eventline will use OAuth2
discovery (https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8414[RFCÂ 8414]) to find
other endpoints.

.Data fields

`issuer` (string) :: The issuer URI.

`discovery` (optional boolean, default to `false`) :: Whether to enable OAuth2
discovery.

`discovery_endpoint` (optional string) :: The URI of the discovery endpoint.
Note that this field will be ignored if `discovery` is false. The default
value is the endpoint mandated by OAuth2 specifications.

`authorization_endpoint` (optional string) :: The URI of the authorization
endpoint. The default value is the endpoint mandated by OAuth2 specifications
or the endpoint found during discovery if `discovery` is true.

`token_endpoint` (optional string) :: The URI of the token
endpoint. The default value is the endpoint mandated by OAuth2 specifications
or the endpoint found during discovery if `discovery` is true.

`client_id` (string) :: The client identifier.

`client_secret` (string) :: The client secret.

`scopes` (string array) :: A comma-separated list of scopes to request.
